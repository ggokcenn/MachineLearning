# Machine Learning
I participated in lectures, took part in different courses, and gained knowledge during this journey. 
I still continue learning so I decided to organize my codes logically, which led me create this repository. 
I believe that what I’ve learnt is not confidential, thus I would like share this repository with others rather than keeping it private.
I set up a schedule for myself, so I upload new files based on my progress. 
Besides, I'm planning to update the codes as I explored some new things. 

## Usage

I upload example files and there is a pdf file called ["User guide for examples"](https://github.com/ggokcenn/MachineLearning/blob/master/User%20guide%20for%20examples.pdf) which has some information about example files.



*I’m hoping this repository proves useful to others the way it has for me.*
